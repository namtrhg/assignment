# Project Title: Reprun assignment

## Description

A simple trading token platform UI.

## Project Structure
-   `components`: For storing re-usable components​​.
-   `data`: Contains mock data for UI rendering.
-   `app`: Default server folder for server-rendering components/ pages. 

## Design Choices

-   **Next.js**: Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities and efficient page loading.
-   **React**: Used for building user interface components with state management.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Provides utility-first styling for rapid UI development.
-   **TypeScript**: Offers type safety for JavaScript code, enhancing development reliability.

## Implementation Details
This is a simple project so I think using NextJS and Tailwind is enough, there is no need for additional UI or state management library. The combination between React hooks, props and Tailwind styling provide everything I need for this assignment.
